//array is a contiguous//unbroken memory space that contains  certian amount of bytes
//computer is only 0 and 1
//1 bytes = 8 bits  1 bit = 0 or 1

// Big o for Array is contant time O(1) for accessing an element
// becuase its gonna take the width of the memory address to find the element 
// so it doesnt matter how big the array is it will take the same amount of time to access the element

//array is fixed size,you cannto grow it,there is no push or pop operation or insert or delete operation what it does is 
// it creates a new array and copies the elements from the old array to the new array
